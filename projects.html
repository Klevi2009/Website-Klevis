      <h2>Project 1</h2>
      <p>Project 1 was where we were put in a group of four with a realistic budget. With that budget we were to buy compatible PC parts and assemble it. After doing so we ran a bench mark test and debated with other groups on who had a better build. This was one of my favorite projects because it was hands on.  </p>

      <h2>Project 2</h2>
      <p>Project 2 was my very first, this project was done with my friend from the 5th grade for the science fair. During this project i learned a lot about volcanos like how they form, erupt, and more. I really enjoyed this because it was also my first time participating in an event. </p>

      <h2>Project 3</h2>
      <p>Project 3 was was to create a scale mode of the solar system. This was my least favorite because it involed a lot of space, time and meterials to make. My least favorite part was finding meterials to create the planets while i was dorming.</p>
