      <p>Hello! I am a first generation imigrant and secnond to graduate after my older sister. My family came to this country in 2009 from Albania when my parents won a lottery for a American green card. When i entered the country i was eight years old, i soon begin to adapt to the changes but it was still hard leaving family behind only to visit every three years. As i grew older my bond friends grew stonger since we were all from diffrent places of the world. Fasting foward 12+ years i enter college, and continure to persue my dream in higher education, i've had a few challenges along the way but its nothing i am not use to. As i've been getting older i never strayed away from my dreams to help people and be the same hard working man as my father.
